In this project I've designed a data warehouse for an Order Processing System in MS SQL. Along with that, also designed data marts, fact tables
and loaded them with relevant facts. Later I used SQL server data tools to create OLAP cubes  and performed the ETL process on the whole data.
For this project I used SQL Server Management Studio 2014 and  Visual Studio 2013
